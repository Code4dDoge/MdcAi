      Ever wish you could take a conversation in more than one direction? Hit the <Bold>Edit</Bold>
      button on any message you've sent. It's like having a storybook where you control the twists and turns — edit your
      message, and off you go down a new path. There's no cap on how creative you can get; the conversation can branch
      out infinitely! And with the <Bold>Previous/Next</Bold> buttons on the Toolbar, you can navigate the tangle of what-ifs
      effortlessly.

      Took a wrong turn in chat? No worries. If the conversation hits a snag or the AI gets it wrong, you're the boss –
      delete the message and take it from the top with fresh words. It's like having a chat "Ctrl+Z"!

    <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
      <Bold>To wrap it up:</Bold> Carve your own path, rewrite to your heart's content, and remember, retracing steps to the original
      convo is always an option. Adventure awaits within your chat—explore away!
