      The "Premise" setting is pivotal—it's like giving the AI its marching orders. Picture it as a mission brief; it
      shapes how the AI approaches conversations by defining its identity and role. Like a sneak peek, the Premise is the
      very first thing the AI encounters, setting the stage for all that follows. You can pack it with context—be it a
      legal document, coding queries, a resume, or even an SVG image in text form—to ensure AI's responses are on point.

      For a dash of fun, go ahead and mold the AI's character. Fancy it to be a bit more humorous, sarcastic, shy, bold,
      or even channel your favorite fictional pirate or a techno-savvy crypto enthusiast? The Premise is your canvas—paint
      its personality with broad strokes or finely-tuned nuances to strike the perfect chord.

      In short, the Premise is your secret ingredient for crafting a truly customized AI experience. It’s your chance
      to infuse creativity and animate the digital mind with a spark of personality. Think of it as the DNA that makes
      your AI uniquely yours.
