      Enhance your workflow by using <Bold>Categories</Bold>. These act not just as organizational units, but as 
      powerful tools to shape distinct AI models. Set preferences like <Hyperlink Click="PremiseHyperlink_OnClick">
        Premise</Hyperlink> and Temperature easily. Think of Categories as your personal AI profiles 
      that adapt the AI behavior to fit specific needs.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
      Reduce repetition in ongoing topics by establishing a bespoke category. This personalization allows you 
      to include standard instructions and contextual background. Say goodbye to re-entering lengthy text for 
      every new chat. Insert extensive documents into the Premise once and let all subsequent conversations in 
      that category benefit automatically.
    </TextBlock>
    <TextBlock TextWrapping="Wrap">
      To kick-start a fresh Category, simply right-click an existing one and opt for <Bold>New Category</Bold>. 
      The settings deployed here become the new norm for every conversation tied to it, but you retain the 
      freedom to fine-tune these settings for individual discussions as needed.
