Effective date: 01/01/2024

## Introduction

This privacy policy ("Policy") applies to the Mdc AI desktop application ("App") developed by Bojan Sala. The App provides users with direct access to the OpenAI API without collecting any personal information or involving any "middlemen" (intermediary services) between its user and the OpenAI API. It is intended to inform users about the App's policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information.

## Information Collection And Use

The App does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information, payments information, or any other sensitive data.

## Local Data Storage

The App stores any necessary data exclusively on the user's local computer within the application's isolated folder managed by Windows and/or Microsoft Store. No data is transmitted to the author or any other third parties other than OpenAI.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses the OpenAI API to provide its services:

- **OpenAI API**: The App interacts with the OpenAI API to provide services to the user. This API is governed by OpenAI's Enterprise Privacy Policy: [https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy).

## Security

Your OpenAI API key is secured by the Windows Credentials Manager (also known as Windows Vault), which uses encryption based on the Windows account (User) with which you are signed into Windows.

Please note that all other data, such as conversations and categories, are stored unencrypted.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

The author reserves the right to update or change the Policy at any time, which will be announced through a notification upon starting the App. Your continued use of the App after any modifications to the Policy will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide by the modified Policy.
