# Some Header

That has some sample code below. This is a longer sentence with more text so that we can see the caret thing better.

Another _paragraph with some crap_ and whatnot
Yet another but *closer* I guess?

```c#
void main()
{
   Console.WriteLine("Hello World. This code is going to be longer than before");

   if (thereIsABug())
   {		
      crashIGuess();
   }
}
```

And that's it.

Some list:
- Item 1 in this list
- Item 2 in the list with more words in it
- Item 3

And that's all.
